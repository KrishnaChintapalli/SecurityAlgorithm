Summary:

- The summary is sufficient and with good quality.


\LaTeX:

- Good usage of tables and items. Good job!

- When using tables, try to use \hline inline with the \\ to make lines.

- When writing \LaTeX, try to keep every line of text within 80 characters or
  100 at the most, then continue in a new line, \LaTeX will continue if you
  break lines.

- \LaTeX files should have the extension .tex not .txt
