Correctness:

- The program produces incorrect output. The program produces a 'null' before
  givin the keys. Example:
$ java Driver < testcase.txt
null
5468617473206D79204B756E67204675
E232FCF191129188B159E4E6D679A293
...

- The program produces output in the incorrect format. See above.


Style:

- There is incorrect indentation in the driver file

- Good block comments

- The header file in the aes class is incorrectly formatted. It should be like
  this:
/**
 * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
 * author: student name
 * course: CMPT 220
 * assignment: project 1
 * due date: August 30, 2003
 * version: 1.3
 *
 * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
 * type.
 */



Efficiency and Other Comments:

- The usage of HashMap may make your program less efficient.
